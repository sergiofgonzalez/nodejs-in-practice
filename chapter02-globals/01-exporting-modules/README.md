> different common techniques to export functionality from Node.js modules

## Description
The example illustrates different common techniques used to export functionality from within modules using `module.exports`:
+ exporting an object of a particular class
+ exporting a class, so that client code can create instances of that class
+ exporting different functions and classes (utility library)

The `index.js` program demonstrates how to use the functionality exported from those modules using `require`.
